1) identify slow queries that other people have encountered
   (or applications that have to update their own database from the original database)
2) elaborate on the queries' requirements and scope
   (per product, metadata_type, all datasets)
Experiments on local database:
1) measure values before creating index (query and insert times, database size)
2) create an index that improves query time
3) measure values after creating index
4) develop case for creation or reason not to create respective indexes
